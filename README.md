# Deployment Environment
## Google Kubernetes Engine
- Our environment for running and deploying containers is GKE which provides the load balancer and SSL certificate.
- The storage class we used is standard-rwo which is a persistent disk that allows reading and writing once.
## Roles
We defined three roles or cluster roles to reduce security risks and configuration errors.
1. **Developer (Role):** Have authority to create, read, update, and delete Pods, Deployments, ConfigMaps, etc. for front and back-end services
2. **Authorization (ClusterRole):** Have broader access to cluster-wide monitoring, logging, updating, maintenance, etc.
3. **CI/CD Manager (ClusterRole):** Have authority to deploy and update applications, which may include access to resources such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
## Network Policy
We designed three network policies to limit **ingress** traffic:
1. Allow all ingress traffic to Web fronted pods
2. Allow all ingress traffic to API backend pods
3. Only all ingress traffic to database pods from Web-fronted pods and API backend pods.

# Operation Commands
